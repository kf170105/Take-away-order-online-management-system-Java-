## Findings ##
TakeAway Order Management System:
I developed a Java-based application to streamline the management of takeaway orders. The system is designed to handle various operations like adding, delivering, displaying, removing, searching, updating and saving customer orders. It's a kind of "main-menu" design which provides multiple choices for users(customers) and once user chooses one of the option, system will bring user to another specific menu related to what the option that user has chosen. In this system, user mainly can choose to order pizza or pasta with or without toppings.

Key Features:
First In First Out (FIFO) Order Delivery: Ensures orders are delivered in the order they were placed using a Queue implementation. This program involved what we have learnt in DSA lesson which is Queue (append/serve or enqueue/dequeue) basic theories. Knowing that Queue theory is commonly applied in restaurant order management.

Datetime record: System records when does the meal order deliver to the customer

Validation: A lot of validations involved in my program to ensure data consistency and logical data such as Customer Details Validation and Topping Selection Validation for either pizza or pasta.

Data Persistence: Ensure customer orders will be saved into a file to avoid data lost issue.

Order Sorting: Allows sorting orders by customer name, total price, or order number for better organization.

Display: Display a complete information regarding what customers have ordered with the total price of the foods.

Technologies Used:
The project leverages Java's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, including abstract classes, interfaces, and enums. It also uses file handling for data persistence and the Collections Framework (ArrayList, LinkedList, Queue) for efficient data management.



This project highlights my ability to design and build a complete software solution, focusing on clean code, scalability, and user-friendly functionality.
